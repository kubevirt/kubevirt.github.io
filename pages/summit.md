## Call for Session Proposals

We are [looking for community members to lead sessions](https://forms.gle/KXaPWpJzk7Z12bRD8) on contributing to, or using, KubeVirt.

We're also looking for one or two tutorials. Submit your proposal(s) by January 17th [via the form](https://forms.gle/KXaPWpJzk7Z12bRD8).  Sessions will be reviewed by the KubeVirt Summit Content Committee.
