  - title: Introducing the new KubeVirt driver for Ansible Molecule
    intro: Molecule is a well known test framework for Ansible. But when you run your Molecule test in Kubernetes, no real good solution exists. I'm working on creating new Molecule driver for KubeVirt to find a better approach and get a 100% pure Kubernetes solution.

  - title: Virtual Machine Batch API
    intro: KubeVirt extends the Kubernetes ReplicaSets API to provide Virtual Machines with similar functionality and the same can be done with Kubernetes Jobs. In order to bulk schedule VirtualMachines, an admin could use a VirtualMachine Batch API, a VirtualMachineJob, to launch many VirtualMachines from a single API call.

  - title: CPU Pinning with custom policies
    intro: KubeVirt supports CPU pinning via the Kubernetes CPU Manager. However there are a few gaps with achieving CPU pinning only via CPU Manager It supports only static policy and doesnâ€™t allow for custom pinning. It supports only Guaranteed QoS class.
