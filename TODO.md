# Identified things that could be improved

## Content

- Sidebar with related articles in same category or with related tags
- Tags and Categories for articles
- RSS generation headers not just for main site, but for tags, etc so users can follow tags of interest (releases, specific author, etc)
- Add a TOC for articles automatically (to ease navigation) (example at: https://iranzo.github.io/blog/2019/03/04/telegram-redken_bot-documentation/)

## Admin / behind the scenes

- Define set of users interested in reviewing PR's to website, community, kubevirt-tutorial, etc to add them to OWNERS/reviewers so that prow requests their feedback
- Investigate alternatives to Disquss (other projects doing this research: https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/issues/288)
- Custom 404 page creation on Github (https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)
