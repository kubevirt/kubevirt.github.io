title: The KubeVirt Summit 2021 is a wrap!
pub-date: Mar 3
pub-year: 2021

Just a few weeks ago, the KubeVirt community had their first ever dedicated
online event, the [KubeVirt Summit]({% link pages/summit.md %})!

We are very happy to have had this opportunity to meet so many community
members, hear from users, vendors and contributors, and learn so many things
about KubeVirt.

If you missed the event, or if you were there and want to remember the great
time we had, the [session recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnLpXX8KHIYyQi7Phsf5-73r5fj1AOBox)
are available in the [KubeVirt YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KubeVirt).

The landing page about the [KubeVirt Summit]({% link pages/summit.md %})
contains a detailed list of all the sessions, with information about the
contents, presenters, and direct links to each session recording and slides
(where available).

## Thanks!

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to make this event happen: all
the presenters / session leads, everyone who proposed a session, the various
community members who contributed to the organization, all the attendees, and
the [Container-native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) who sponsored the
event.

## I want more!

We are just wrapping up this first edition. Based on this experience, we really
hope to have more community events of this type in the future, but it is still a
bit early to say when/where how.

For now, please keep the conversations going through the various community channels:

  - The [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev)
  - The [#virtualization Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C8ED7RKFE) in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/)
  - Our [community meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=18pc0jur01k8f2cccvn5j04j1g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Etc%2FGMT)
  - The [github repositories](https://github.com/kubevirt)
  - Twitter: [@kubevirt](https://twitter.com/kubevirt)
