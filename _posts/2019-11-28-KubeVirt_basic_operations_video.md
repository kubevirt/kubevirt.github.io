In this video we are showing how KubeVirt can be used from a begginer point of view.

## Pre-requisites

In the video there is a Kubernetes cluster together with KubeVirt already running. If you need help for preparing that setup you can check the [KubeVirt installation notes](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/administration/intro.html) or try it yourself in the [First steps with KubeVirt](https://www.katacoda.com/kubevirt/scenarios/kubevirt-101) Katacoda scenario.
Also the `virtctl` command is already placed in a directory pointed from the PATH variable.
