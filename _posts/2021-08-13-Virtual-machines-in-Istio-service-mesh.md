## Introduction

This blog post demonstrates running virtual machines in [Istio](https://istio.io/) service mesh.

Istio service mesh allows to monitor, visualize, and manage traffic between pods and external services by
injecting a proxy container - a sidecar - which forwards inbound and outbound traffic of a pod/virtual machine.
This allows the sidecar to collect metadata about the proxied traffic and also actively interfere with it. For more in-depth information about the Istio proxy mechanism, see [this blog post](https://medium.com/open-5g-hypercore/episode-iii-meshville-7f0bb7ca0e3b) published by Dough Smith et al.

The main features of Istio are traffic shifting (migrating traffic from an old to new version of a service), dynamic request routing, fault injection or traffic mirroring for testing/debugging purposes, and more.
Visit [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/) to learn about all its features.
Istio featureset may be further extended by installing addons. Kiali, for example, is a UI dashboard that provides traffic information
of all microservices in a mesh, capable of composing communication graph between all microservices.

## Prerequisites

- KubeVirt `v0.43.0`
- CRI-O `v1.19.0`

## Limitations

Istio is only supported with masquerade network binding and pod network over IPv4.

## Demo

This section covers deployment of a local cluster with Istio service mesh, KubeVirt installation and creation of an Istio-enabled virtual machine.
Finally, Kiali dashboard is used to examine both inbound and outbound traffic of the created virtual machine.

### Run Kubernetes cluster

In this blog post, we are going to use [kubevirtci](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirtci) as our Kubernetes ephemeral cluster provider.

Follow these steps to deploy a local cluster with pre-installed Istio service mesh:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirtci
cd kubevirtci
export KUBEVIRTCI_TAG=2108222252-0007793
# Pin to version used in this blog post in case
# k8s-1.21 provider version disappears in the future
git checkout $KUBEVIRTCI_TAG
export KUBEVIRT_NUM_NODES=2
export KUBEVIRT_PROVIDER=k8s-1.21
export KUBEVIRT_DEPLOY_ISTIO=true
export KUBEVIRT_WITH_CNAO=true
make cluster-up
export KUBECONFIG=$(./cluster-up/kubeconfig.sh)
```

For details about Istio configuration, see Istio kubevirtci [install script](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirtci/blob/2108081530-91f55e3/cluster-provision/k8s/1.21/istio.sh).

### Install Kubevirt

Following KubeVirt [user guide](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/#installing-kubevirt-on-kubernetes) to install released version `v0.43.0`:

```bash
export RELEASE=v0.43.0
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${RELEASE}/kubevirt-operator.yaml"
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/${RELEASE}/kubevirt-cr.yaml"
kubectl -n kubevirt wait kv kubevirt --timeout=180s --for condition=Available
```

### Install Istio addons

While the ephemeral kubevirtci installs core Istio components, addons like Kiali dashboard are not installed by default.
Download Istio manifests and client binary by running the following command:

```bash
export ISTIO_VERSION=1.10.0
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
```

and export path to the istioctl binary by following the output of the above command.

Finally, deploy Kiali, Jaeger and Prometheus addons:

```bash
kubectl create -f istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}/samples/addons/kiali.yaml
kubectl create -f istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}/samples/addons/jaeger.yaml
kubectl create -f istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}/samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
```

**Note:** If there are errors when installing the addons, try running the command again. There may be timing issues which will be resolved when the command is run again.

### Prepare target namespace

Before creating virtual machines, the target namespace needs to be configured for the Istio sidecar to be injected and working properly.
This involves adding a label and creating a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` in the target namespace.

#### Istio sidecar injection

Istio supports [two ways of injecting](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/) a sidecar to a pod - automatic and manual. For simplicity, we will only consider automatic sidecar injection in this demo, which is enabled by adding `istio-injection=enabled` label to target namespace:

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

#### Network attachment definiton

When Multus is installed in k8s cluster, a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` called `istio-cni` **must** be created in **each** namespace where Istio sidecar containers are to be used:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: istio-cni
EOF
```

The `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` spec is empty, as its only purpose is to trigger the `istio-cni` binary, which configures the in-pod traffic routing.

### Topology

To demonstrate monitoring and tracing capabilities, we will create two VMIs within Istio service mesh:

- `istio-vmi` repeatedly requests external HTTP service kubevirt.io, and serves a simple HTTP server on port 8080,
- `cirros-vmi` repeatedly request the HTTP service running on the `istio-vmi` VMI.

With this setup, both inbound and outbound
traffic metrics can be observed in Kiali dashboard for `istio-vmi`.

### Create VMI resources

An Istio aware virtual machine **must** be annotated with `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"`, regardless of used Istio injection mechanism.
Without this annotation, traffic would not be properly routed through the istio proxy sidecar.
Additonally, Istio uses `app` label for adding contextual information to the collected telemetry.
Both, the annotation and label can be seen in the following virtual machine example:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  annotations:
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
  labels:
    app: istio-vmi
  name: istio-vmi
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: default
          masquerade: {}
          ports:
            - port: 8080
      disks:
        - disk:
            bus: virtio
          name: containerdisk
        - disk:
            bus: virtio
          name: cloudinitdisk
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 1024M
  networks:
    - name: default
      pod: {}
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 120
    periodSeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 3
    successThreshold: 3
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
  volumes:
    - name: containerdisk
      containerDisk:
        image: kubevirt/fedora-cloud-container-disk-demo:devel
    - cloudInitNoCloud:
        userData: |
          #cloud-config
          password: fedora
          chpasswd: { expire: False }
          runcmd:
          - dnf install -y screen nc
          - while true ; do sh -c "nc -lp 8080 -c  \"echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nHello'\" " ; done &
          - while true ; do curl kubevirt.io >out 2>/dev/null ; sleep 1 ; done &
      name: cloudinitdisk
EOF
```

The cloud init section of the VMI runs two loops requesting `kubevirt.io` website every second to generate outbound traffic (from the VMI) and serving simple HTTP server on port `8080`, which will be used for monitoring of inbound traffic (to the VMI).

Let's also create a service for the VMI that will be used to access the http server in `istio-vmi`:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f-
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: istio-vmi-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: istio-vmi
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
EOF
```

Finally, create the `cirros-vmi` VMI, for the purpose of generating inbound traffic to `istio-vmi` VMI:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  annotations:
    sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
  name: cirros-vmi
  labels:
    app: cirros-vmi
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      interfaces:
        - name: default
          masquerade: {}
      disks:
        - disk:
            bus: virtio
          name: containerdisk
        - disk:
            bus: virtio
          name: cloudinitdisk
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 128M
  networks:
    - name: default
      pod: {}
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
  volumes:
    - name: containerdisk
      containerDisk:
        image: kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:devel
    - name: cloudinitdisk
      cloudInitNoCloud:
        userData: |
          #!/bin/sh
          while true ; do curl istio-vmi-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:8080 ; sleep 1 ; done
EOF
```

Wait for the `istio-vmi` to be ready:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --timeout=180s pod -l app=istio-vmi
```

After creating the VMIs, the corresponding virt-launcher pods should have 3 ready containers, as shown in the snippet below:

```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
virt-launcher-istio-vmi-XYZ      3/3     Running   0          4m13s
virt-launcher-cirros-vmi-XYZ     3/3     Running   0          2m21s
```

`Istioctl proxy-status` should report that the sidecar proxies running inside the virt-launcher pods have synced with Istio control plane:

```bash
istioctl proxy-status
NAME                                          CDS        LDS        EDS        RDS          ISTIOD                      VERSION
virt-launcher-cirros-vmi-9f765.default        SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istiod-7d96484d6b-5d79g     1.10.0
virt-launcher-istio-vmi-99t8t.default         SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED     SYNCED       istiod-7d96484d6b-nk4cd     1.10.0
```

**Note:** Displaying only relevant VMI entities.

### Monitor traffic in Kiali dashboard

With both VMIs up and running, we can open the Kiali dashboard and observe the traffic metrics.
Run the following command, to access Kiali dashboard:

```bash
istioctl dashboard kiali
```

#### Topology graph

Let's start by navigating to the topology graph by clicking the Graph menu item.

<br>
<div class="my-gallery" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure
    itemprop="associatedMedia"
    itemscope
    itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"
  >
    <a
      href="/assets/2021-08-13-Virtual-machines-in-Istio-service-mesh/topology-graph.png"
      itemprop="contentUrl"
      data-size="800x530"
    >
      <img
        src="/assets/2021-08-13-Virtual-machines-in-Istio-service-mesh/topology-graph.png"
        itemprop="thumbnail"
        width="100%"
        alt="Topology graph"
      />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="Topology graph of deployed VMIs showing the traffic flows"></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

In the topology graph, we can observe the following traffic flows:

- requests from `cirros-vmi` to `istio-vmi` via `istio-vmi-svc` service,
- requests from `istio-vmi` to `PasstroughCluster`. The `PastroughCluster` marks  destinations external to our service mesh.

#### Workloads

Navigate to `istio-vmi` workload overview by clicking the `Workloads` menu item and selecting `istio-vmi` from the list.

The overview page presents partial topology graph with traffic related to `istio-vmi`. In our case, this graph is the same as the graph of our entire mesh.

Navigate to Inbound Metrics tab to see metrics charts of inbound traffic.

<br>
<div class="my-gallery" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageGallery">
  <figure
    itemprop="associatedMedia"
    itemscope
    itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"
  >
    <a
      href="/assets/2021-08-13-Virtual-machines-in-Istio-service-mesh/istio-blog-vmi-istio-inbound-traffic.png"
      itemprop="contentUrl"
      data-size="800x530"
    >
      <img
        src="/assets/2021-08-13-Virtual-machines-in-Istio-service-mesh/istio-blog-vmi-istio-inbound-traffic.png"
        itemprop="thumbnail"
        width="100%"
        alt="Inbound traffic metrics"
      />
    </a>
    <figcaption itemprop="Inbound traffic metrics for `istio-vmi`"></figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

In Request volume chart we can see that number of requests stabilizes at around `1 ops`, which matches our loop sending one reqest per second. Request throughput chart reveals that the requests consume around `4 kbit/s` of bandwidth.
Remaining two charts provide information about Request duration and size.

The same metrics are collected for outbound traffic as well, which can be seen in Outbound Metrics tab.

## Cluster teardown

Run the following command to deprovision the ephemeral cluster:

```bash
make cluster-down
```

## Conclusion

KubeVirt introduced [support for Istio](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/istio_service_mesh/), allowing virtual machines to be part of a service mesh.

This blog post covered running KubeVirt virtual machine in Istio service mesh using an ephemeral kubevirtci cluster. Kiali dashboard was used to observe inbound and outbound traffic of a virtual machine.
