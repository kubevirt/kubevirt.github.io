rapidly approaching and promises to be another jam packed event for followers of
cloud-native technologies.

a guide to where you are likely to find [KubeVirt][2] featured at the event.
These sessions will provide you an opportunity not just to learn about
KubeVirt's to turning [Kubernetes][3] into a common platform for containers and
virtual machines, but also to meet other members of the community:
