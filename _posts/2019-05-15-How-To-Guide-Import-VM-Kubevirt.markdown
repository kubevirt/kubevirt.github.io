# Importing a VM into the Kubernetes Native Environment

Motivation: Kubernetes have become the new way to orchestrate the containers and to handle the microservice architecture, but what if I already have legacy apps running on my old VM's in my datacenter ? Can those apps ever be made k8s friendly ? Well if that is the usecase for you then we have a solution now with kubevirt.

In this blog post we will discuss about how to deploy VM as a yaml template and steps on how to import it as a [PVC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) onto your kubernetes environment using the CDI and kubevirt add-ons.

**Assumptions:**

- A basic understanding of the k8s architecture: In its simplest terms Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available. For complete details check [Kubernetes-architecture](https://www.aquasec.com/wiki/display/containers/Kubernetes+Architecture+101)

- User is familiar with the concept of a [virsh based VM](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-guest_virtual_machine_installation_overview-creating_guests_with_virt_install)

- PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system. [Persistent Volume(PV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) and Persistent Volume Claim PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only). [Persistent Volume Claim(PVC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims).

- User is familiar with the concept of [kubevirt-architecture](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/master/docs/architecture.md) and [CDI-architecture](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/blob/master/doc/design.md#design)

- User has already installed kubevirt in his K8s environment, if not please follow the link [Installing Kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/administration/intro.html#installation)

# Virtual machines:

**Virtual machines:**
A VirtualMachine provides additional management capabilities to a VirtualMachineInstance inside the cluster. That includes:

- ABI stability

- Start/stop/restart capabilities on the controller level

- Offline configuration change with propagation on VirtualMachineInstance recreation

- Ensure that the VirtualMachineInstance is running if it should be running

It focuses on a 1:1 relationship between the controller instance and a virtual machine instance. In many ways it is very similar to a StatefulSet with spec.replica set to 1.

# How to use a VirtualMachine:

**Starting and stopping**

After creating a VirtualMachine it can be switched on or off like this:

```shell
# Start the virtual machine:
virtctl start myvm

# Stop the virtual machine:
virtctl stop myvm
```
Kubectl can be used for the same:

```shell
# Start the virtual machine:
kubectl patch virtualmachine myvm --type merge -p \
    '{"spec":{"running":true}}'

# Stop the virtual machine:
kubectl patch virtualmachine myvm --type merge -p \
    '{"spec":{"running":false}}'
```
**VM defined in a `yaml` format:**

In general, VM's can be defined as a `yaml` manifests and can be deployed as k8s objects, a simple example of a VM  in a yaml format is below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: vm-cirros
  name: vm-cirros
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-cirros
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: containerdisk
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: cloudinitdisk
        machine:
          type: ""
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 64M
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
      volumes:
      - name: containerdisk
        containerDisk:
          image: kubevirt/cirros-container-disk-demo:latest
      - cloudInitNoCloud:
          userDataBase64: IyEvYmluL3NoCgplY2hvICdwcmludGVkIGZyb20gY2xvdWQtaW5pdCB1c2VyZGF0YScK
        name: cloudinitdisk

```
**Note**: 
From the above manifest, `kind: VirtualMachine` states that its a VM object, `spec.domain.device.name` section and `spec.volumes.name` should match. In the later section of this Blog you will see how this is all gets connected in the context of CDI.

**Note**:

- More examples of a VM declared as a `yaml` manifest can be seen [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/tree/master/cluster/examples)

- Please feel free to take a look at how to deploy VM as a K8s object by using kubevirt add-on using minikube [here](https://kubevirt.io//quickstart_minikube/)

For detailed usage of Volumes, you can take a look at [here](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/creating-virtual-machines/disks-and-volumes.html)

Now, we have seen how a VM can be declared as a yaml object inside kubernetes, we will now see how CDI and kubevirt help in getting our VM workload into the cluster.Next immediate question that comes to our mind is "How to use a Virtual Machine in my k8s cluster?", ok, lets see how all of this is made possible.

A VirtualMachine will make sure that a VirtualMachineInstance object with an identical name will be present in the cluster, if `spec.running` is set to `true`. Further it will make sure that a VirtualMachineInstance will be removed from the cluster if `spec.running` is set to `false`.

There exists a field `spec.runStrategy` which can also be used to control the state of the associated VirtualMachineInstance object. To avoid confusing and contradictory states, these fields are mutually exclusive. An extended explanation of `spec.runStrategy` vs `spec.running` can be found in [Run Strategies](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/docs/latest/architecture/creating-virtual-machines/run-strategies.html).

Saving this manifest into vm.yaml and submitting it to Kubernetes will create the controller instance:

```shell
$ kubectl create -f vm.yaml
virtualmachine "vm-cirros" created
```
Since spec.running is set to false, no vmi will be created:

```shell
$ kubectl get vmis
No resources found.
```
Let’s start the VirtualMachine:

```shell
$ virtctl start omv vm-cirros
```

As expected, a VirtualMachineInstance called vm-cirros got created:

```shell
$ kubectl describe vm vm-cirros

Since we were able to start and stop the VM instance, now lets shift our focus on importing the VM.

**Creating Virtual Machines from local images with CDI and virtctl:**

The [Containerized Data Importer (CDI)](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer) project provides facilities for enabling Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to be used as disks for KubeVirt VMs. The three main CDI use cases are:

- Import a disk image from a URL to a PVC (HTTP/S3)

- Clone an an existing PVC

- Upload a local disk image to a PVC

This document for now deals with the third use case and covers the HTTP based import use case at the end of the BlogPost. So you should have CDI installed in your cluster, a VM disk that you’d like to upload, and virtctl in your path.

Lets begin by installing the latest CDI release [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/releases) (currently v1.9.0)

```shell
VERSION=v1.9.0
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/releases/download/$VERSION/cdi-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/releases/download/$VERSION/cdi-operator-cr.yaml
```

**Expose cdi-uploadproxy service:**

The cdi-uploadproxy service must be accessible from outside the cluster. Here are some ways to do that:

- [NodePort Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport)

- [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)

- [Route](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/architecture/networking/routes.html)

We can take a look at example manifests [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer/blob/master/doc/upload.md)

The supported image formats are:

- .img

- .iso

- .qcow2

- Also compressed .tar, .gz and .xz of the above are supported.

This Blog uses [this](http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.4.0/cirros-0.4.0-x86_64-disk.img) [CirrOS](https://launchpad.net/cirros) Image(in a .img format)

we can use `virtctl` command for uploading the image as shown below:

```shell
virtctl image-upload --help
Upload a VM image to a PersistentVolumeClaim.

Usage:
  virtctl image-upload [flags]

Examples:
  # Upload a local disk image to a newly created PersistentVolumeClaim:
    virtctl image-upload --upload-proxy-url=https://cdi-uploadproxy.mycluster.com --pvc-name=upload-pvc --pvc-size=10Gi --image-path=/images/fedora28.qcow2

Flags:
      --access-mode string       The access mode for the PVC. (default "ReadWriteOnce")
  -h, --help                     help for image-upload
      --image-path string        Path to the local VM image.
      --insecure                 Allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS.
      --no-create                Don't attempt to create a new PVC.
      --pvc-name string          The destination PVC.
      --pvc-size string          The size of the PVC to create (ex. 10Gi, 500Mi).
      --storage-class string     The storage class for the PVC.
      --uploadproxy-url string   The URL of the cdi-upload proxy service.
      --wait-secs uint           Seconds to wait for upload pod to start. (default 60)

Use "virtctl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
```

Here, `virtctl image-upload` works by creating a PVC of the requested size, sending an `UploadTokenRequest` to the `cdi-apiserver`, and uploading the file to the `cdi-uploadproxy`.

```shell
virtctl image-upload --pvc-name=cirros-vm-disk --pvc-size=500Mi --image-path=/home/shegde/images/cirros-0.4.0-x86_64-disk.img --uploadproxy-url=<url to upload proxy service>
```

**To create a VirtualMachineInstance from a PVC:**

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
metadata:
  name: cirros-vm
spec:
  domain:
    devices:
      disks:
      - disk:
          bus: virtio
        name: pvcdisk
    machine:
      type: ""
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
  volumes:
  - name: pvcdisk
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: cirros-vm-disk
status: {}
EOF
```
**Note**: As we are aware, the data inside are ephemeral meaning its lost when the VM restarts, in order to prevent that and provide a persistent data storage we use PVC.
`persistentVolumeClaim` Allows connecting a PersistentVolumeClaim to a VM disk.

A PersistentVolume can be in filesystem'' or block'' mode:

Filesystem: For KubeVirt to be able to consume the disk present on a PersistentVolume’s filesystem, the disk must be named disk.img and be placed in the root path of the filesystem. Currently the disk is also required to be in raw format. 

**Important:** The disk.img image file needs to be owned by the user-id 107 in order to avoid permission issues.

**Quick-Note:** If the disk.img image file has not been created manually before starting a VM then it will be created automatically with the PersistentVolumeClaim size. Since not every storage provisioner provides volumes with the exact usable amount of space as requested (e.g. due to filesystem overhead), KubeVirt tolerates up to 10% less available space. This can be configured with the pvc-tolerate-less-space-up-to-percent value in the kubevirt-config ConfigMap.

Block: Use a block volume for consuming raw block devices. To do that user needs to enable the BlockVolume feature gate.


A simple example which attaches a PersistentVolumeClaim as a disk may look like this:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: testvmi-pvc
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
spec:
  domain:
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 64M
    devices:
      disks:
      - name: mypvcdisk
        lun: {}
  volumes:
    - name: mypvcdisk
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: mypvc
```

**Connect to VirtualMachineInstance console**

Use virtctl to connect to the newly create VirtualMachinInstance.

```shell
virtctl console cirros-vm
```

The above method explains the import of the VM by importing the locally available image, now lets see the concept of DataVolumes:

# DataVolume:

DataVolumes are a way to automate importing virtual machine disks onto pvcs during the virtual machine’s launch flow. Without using a DataVolume, users have to prepare a pvc with a disk image before assigning it to a VM or VMI manifest. With a DataVolume, both the pvc creation and import is automated on behalf of the user.

DataVolume VM Behavior
DataVolumes can be defined in the VM spec directly by adding the DataVolumes to the dataVolumeTemplates list. Below is an example.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: vm-alpine-datavolume
  name: vm-alpine-datavolume
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm-alpine-datavolume
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
          - disk:
              bus: virtio
            name: datavolumedisk1
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 64M
      volumes:
      - dataVolume:                #Note the type is dataVolume
          name: alpine-dv
        name: datavolumedisk1
  dataVolumeTemplates:             # Automatically a PVC of size 2Gi is created
  - metadata:
      name: alpine-dv
    spec:
      pvc:
        accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 2Gi
      source:                      #This is the source where the iso file resides
        http:
          url: http://cdi-http-import-server.kubevirt/images/alpine.iso
```
From the above manifest the two main sections that needs an attention are **`source`** and **`pvc`**.

The `source` part declares that there is a disk image living on an http server that we want to use as a volume for this VM. The `pvc` part declares the spec that should be used to create the pvc that hosts the source data.

When this VM manifest is posted to the cluster, as part of the launch flow a pvc will be created using the spec provided and the source data will be automatically imported into that pvc before the VM starts. When the VM is deleted, the storage provisioned by the DataVolume will automatically be deleted as well.

**A few caveats to be considered before using DataVolumes:**

**A few caveats to be considered before using DataVolumes:**

A DataVolume is a custom resource provided by the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) project. KubeVirt integrates with CDI in order to provide users a workflow for dynamically creating pvcs and importing data into those pvcs.

In order to take advantage of the `DataVolume` volume source on a VM or VMI, the DataVolumes feature gate must be enabled in the `kubevirt-config` config map before KubeVirt is installed. CDI must also be installed(follow the steps as mentioned above).

# Enabling the DataVolumes feature gate:

Below is an example of how to enable DataVolume support using the kubevirt-config config map.

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
  namespace: kubevirt
  labels:
    kubevirt.io: ""
data:
  feature-gates: "DataVolumes"
EOF
```
This config map assumes KubeVirt will be installed in the kubevirt namespace. Change the namespace to suite your installation.

First post the configmap above, then install KubeVirt. At that point DataVolume integration will be enabled.

# Conclusion:

VM can be imported as a k8s object using a CDI project along with kubevirt. For more detailed insights, please feel free to follow the [kubevirt project](https://kubevirt.io/)
