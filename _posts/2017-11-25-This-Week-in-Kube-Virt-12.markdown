This is a weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

We are currently driven by

-   Being easier to be used on Kubernetes and OpenShift

-   Enabling people to contribute

This week we was really slow, but we still achieved to:

-   Improve vagrant setup (@cynepco3hahue)
    (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/586>)

In addition to this, we are also working on:

-   GlusterFS support (@humblec)
    (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/578>)

-   Describe how device assignment can work (@mpolednik)
    (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/593>)
