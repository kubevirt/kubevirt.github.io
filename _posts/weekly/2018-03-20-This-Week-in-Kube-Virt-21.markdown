This is a weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

In general there is now more work happening outside of the core kubevirt
repository.

<!-- more -->

We are currently driven by

- Building a solid user-story around KubeVirt

- Caring about end-to-end (backend, core, ui)

- Getting dependencies into shape (storage)

- Improve the user-experience for users (UI, deployment)

- Being easier to be used on Kubernetes and OpenShift

Within the last two weeks we achieved to:

- Multi platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) support for virtctl (@slintes)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/811>)

- Stable UUIDs for OfflineVirtualMachines (@fromanirh)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/766>)

- OpenShift support for CI (@alukiano, @rmohr)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/792>)

- v2v improvements - for easier imports of existing VMs (@pkliczewski)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/v2v-job>)

- Data importer - to import existing disk images (@copejon @jeffvance)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer>)

- POC Device Plugins for KVM and network (@mpolednik @phoracek)
  <https://github.com/kubevirt/kubernetes-device-plugins>

In addition to this, we are also working on:

- Subresources for consoles (@davidvossel)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/770>)

- Additional network glue approach (@vladikr)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/787>)

- virtctl convenience functions for start/stop of VMs (@sgott)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/817>)
