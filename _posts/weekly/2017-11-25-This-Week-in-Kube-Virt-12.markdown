This is a weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

We are currently driven by

- Enabling people to contribute

<!-- more -->

This week we was really slow, but we still achieved to:

- Improve vagrant setup (@cynepco3hahue)

In addition to this, we are also working on:

- GlusterFS support (@humblec)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/578>)

- Describe how device assignment can work (@mpolednik)
  (<https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/593>)
