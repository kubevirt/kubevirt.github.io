This is a bi-weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

We are currently driven by

- Building a solid user-story around KubeVirt

- Caring about end-to-end (backend, core, ui)

- Getting dependencies into shape (storage)

- Improve the user-experience for users (UI, deployment)

- Being easier to be used on Kubernetes and OpenShift
