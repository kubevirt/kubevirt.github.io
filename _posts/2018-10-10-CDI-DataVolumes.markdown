# CDI DataVolumes

Containerized Data Importer (or CDI for short), is a data import service for Kubernetes designed with KubeVirt in mind. Thanks to CDI, we can now enjoy the addition of DataVolumes, which greatly improve the workflow of managing KubeVirt and its storage.

## What it does

DataVolumes are an abstraction of the Kubernetes resource, PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) and it also leverages other CDI features to ease the process of importing data into a Kubernetes cluster.

DataVolumes can be defined by themselves or embedded within a VirtualMachine resource definition, the first method can be used to orchestrate events based on the DataVolume status phases while the second eases the process of providing storage for a VM.

## How does it work?

In this blog post, I'd like to focus on the second method, embedding the information within a VirtualMachine definition, which might seem like the most immediate benefit of this feature. Let's get started!

### Environment description

- **OpenShift**

  For testing DataVolumes, I've spawned a new OpenShift cluster, using dynamic provisioning for storage running OpenShift Cloud Storage (GlusterFS), so the Persistent Volumes (PVs for short) are created on-demand. Other than that, it's a regular OpenShift cluster, running with a single master (also used for infrastructure components) and two compute nodes.

- **CDI**

  We also need CDI, of course, CDI can be deployed either together with KubeVirt or independently, the instructions can be found in the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer).

- **KubeVirt**

  Last but not least, we'll need KubeVirt to run the VMs that will make use of the DataVolumes.

### Enabling DataVolumes feature

As of this writing, DataVolumes have to be enabled through a [feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/), for KubeVirt, this is achieved by creating the _kubevirt-config_ ConfigMap on the namespace where KubeVirt has been deployed, by default _kube-system_.

Let's create the ConfigMap with the following definition:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  feature-gates: DataVolumes
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kubevirt-config
  namespace: kube-system
```

```shell
$ oc create -f kubevirt-config-cm.yml
```

Alternatively, the following one-liner can also be used to achieve the same result:

```shell
$ oc create configmap kubevirt-config --from-literal feature-gates=DataVolumes -n kube-system
```

If the ConfigMap was already present on the system, just use `oc edit` to add the DataVolumes feature gate under the _data_ field like the YAML above.

If everything went as expected, we should see the following log lines on the _virt-controller_ pods:

```
level=info timestamp=2018-10-09T08:16:53.602400Z pos=application.go:173 component=virt-controller msg="DataVolume integration enabled"
```

> **NOTE**: It's worth noting the values in the ConfigMap are not dynamic, in the sense that _virt-controller_ and _virt-api_ will need to be _restarted_, scaling their deployments down and back up again, just remember to scale it up to the same number of replicas they previously had.

## Creating a VirtualMachine embedding a DataVolume

Now that the cluster is ready to use the feature, let's have a look at our VirtualMachine definition, which includes a DataVolume.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha2
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: testvm1
  name: testvm1
spec:
  dataVolumeTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: centos7-dv
      spec:

          resources:

        source:
          http:
            url: "https://cloud.centos.org/centos/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2"
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: testvm1
    spec:

        devices:
          disks:
            - volumeName: test-datavolume
              name: disk0
              disk:
                bus: virtio
            - name: cloudinitdisk
              volumeName: cloudinitvolume
              cdrom:
                bus: virtio
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: 8Gi
      volumes:
        - dataVolume:
            name: centos7-dv
          name: test-datavolume
        - cloudInitNoCloud:
            userData: |
              #cloud-config
              hostname: testvm1
              users:
                - name: kubevirt
                  gecos: KubeVirt Project
                  sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
                  passwd: $6$JXbc3063IJir.e5h$ypMlYScNMlUtvQ8Il1ldZi/mat7wXTiRioGx6TQmJjTVMandKqr.jJfe99.QckyfH/JJ.OdvLb5/OrCa8ftLr.
                  shell: /bin/bash
                  home: /home/kubevirt
                  lock_passwd: false
          name: cloudinitvolume
```

The new addition to a regular VirtualMachine definition is the _dataVolumeTemplates_ block, which will trigger the import of the CentOS-7 cloud image defined on the _url_ field, storing it on a PV, the resulting DataVolume will be named _centos7-dv_, being referenced on the _volumes_ section, it will serve as the boot disk (disk0) for our VirtualMachine.

Going ahead and applying the above manifest to our cluster results in the following set of events:

- The DataVolume is created, triggering the creation of a PVC and therefore, using the dynamic provisioning configured on the cluster, a PV is provisioned to satisfy the needs of the PVC.
- An importer pod is started, this pod is the one actually downloading the image defined in the _url_ field and storing it on the provisioned PV.
- Once the image has been downloaded and stored, the DataVolume status changes to _Succeeded_, from that point the virt launcher controller will go ahead and schedule the VirtualMachine.

Taking a look to the resources created after applying the VirtualMachine manifest, we can see the following:

```shell
$ oc get pods
NAME                          READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
importer-centos7-dv-t9zx2     0/1       Completed   0          11m
virt-launcher-testvm1-cpt8n   1/1       Running     0          8m
```

Let's look at the importer pod logs to understand what it did:

```shell
$ oc logs importer-centos7-dv-t9zx2

```

So, following the events we see, it fetched the image from the defined _url_, validated its format and converted it to _raw_ for being used by _qemu_.

The DataVolume description matches what was defined under _dataVolumeTemplates_. Now, as we know it uses a PV/PVC underneath, let's have a look:

```shell
$ oc describe pvc centos7-dv

```

It's important to pay attention to the annotations, these are monitored/set by CDI. CDI triggers an import when it detects the _cdi.kubevirt.io/storage.import.endpoint_, assigns a pod as the import task owner and updates the pod phase annotation.

At this point, everything is in place, the DataVolume has its underlying components, the image has been imported so now the VirtualMachine can start the VirtualMachineInstance based on its definition and using the CentOS7 image as boot disk, as users we can connect to its console as usual, for instance running the following command:

```shell
$ virtctl console testvm1
```

## Cleaning it up

Once we're happy with the results, it's time to clean up all these tests. The task is easy:

```shell
$ oc delete vm testvm1
```

Once the VM (and its associated VMI) are gone, all the underlying storage resources are removed, there is no trace of the PVC, PV or DataVolume.

```shell
$ oc get dv centos7-dv
$ oc get pvc centos7-dv
$ oc get pv pvc-191d27c6-cbc0-11e8-b467-c81f666533c3
```

All three commands returned _No resources found_.
