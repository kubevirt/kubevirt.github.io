Some time ago, with the PR <https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/265>, KubeVirt was proposed to be part of the CNCF Sandbox.

On 9th September 2019, the project has finally accomplished the required steps to get in (including two sponsors) to get listed as part of it at <https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/>

The document with the proposal can be read at the final repo at <https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/proposals/kubevirt.adoc> for more information.

It's interesting to see the messages of support at the PR that show interesting use cases by our users, so keep an eye on them!
