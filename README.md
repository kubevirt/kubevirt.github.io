# KubeVirt.io Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubevirt/kubevirt.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kubevirt/kubevirt.github.io)

## Creating a Blog Post

All Blog posts are located in the `/_posts` directory. Each file is a Markdown (`.md`) file.

In order to create a blog post for KubeVirt.io, you need to complete the following steps:

- create a markdown file with a `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE` naming convention
- in the Front Matter (Jekyll configuration for a Blog post), you need to add the following:

```jekyll
---
layout: post
author: Your Name
description: Title of Blog Post
navbar_active: Blogs
pub-date: June 20
pub-year: 2018
category: news
comments: true
---
```

- `layout`: The layout is for the type of site layout that this uses. All Blog posts use the **posts** layout.
- `author`: Author is the name you would like to appear on the post. It is recommended to either use your GitHub username, Twitter handle, or another identifier that is known in the community.
- `description`: This is what will appear as the title of the Blog post.
- `navbar_active: Blogs`: This should not be changed, as it governs how the navigation appears.
- `pub-date`: This is the month and day that the Blog post was published. This should match the month and day in the file name.
- `pub-year`: This is the year that the Blog post was published. A cateogry of posts groups them by year.This should match the year in the file name.
- `category`: If desired, you can add a category to the post. If you do not wish it to be specifically categorized, please use **uncategorized**.
- `comments: true`: This enables the Disqus comments at the bottom of the post. If you do not wish a post to have commenting, do not include this line.

## Create a Page

All Pages are located in the `/pages` directory, and then broken down into the navigation section (i.e. `/blogs`, `/docs`, `/videos`, etc.). Each page should have the following Front Matter configuration:

```jekyll
---
layout: default
title: Introduction
permalink: /docs/
navbar_active: Docs
---
```

- `layout`: The layout is the type of site layout that the page uses. In this case, it is the default layout (includes header, body, and footer).
- `title`: This is the title of the page. It will appear at the top of the page, as well as in the browser navigation tab.
- `permalink`: This is the subsection that the page lives under. In this case, it is under `/docs/` and is the primary page of the Docs link. If you want this to be a page other than the primary, add the correct name afterwards (i.e. `/docs/authorization`).
- `navbar_active`: This selects which primary navigation item should be set as *active*. Use **Docs** for Documentation, **Blogs** for Blog Posts, and **Videos** for Videos. These are case-sensitive.

If you add a new page and want it to appear in the sidebar of that section (such as the sidebar under **Docs**), then you also need to update the `yaml` file associated with that group. These are located under `_data/`. For **Docs**, you would update `docs_toc.yml`, following the structure that currently exists within that file.

## Creating a Lab

All Labs are located in the `/labs` directory, and then broken down into their individual labs. Each Lab should contain a landing page, allowing users to enter (or allow the site to link to) the starting page of a specific lab - i.e. `/labs/kubernetes/kubernetes.html`.

### Lab Landing Pages

Each Lab landing page should have the following Font Matter configuration:

```jekyll
---
layout: kubernetes
title: Kubernetes Lab
order: 1
permalink: labs/kubernetes.html
---
```

As can be seen, each page requires a particular layout - this ensures that the Table of Contents reads through the correct collections and builds properly.

### Lab Files

Once the landing page and layout has been created, the individual lab steps can now be added. These need to be place in the same directory as the landing page - i.e. `/labs/kubernetes/`. Labs should be named `lab1.md`, replacing the number as necessary. This ensures that the pages are ordered properly in the Table of Contents.

Lab Front Matter should be configured as follows:

```jekyll
---
layout: kubernetes
title: Use KubeVirt
permalink: /labs/kubernetes/lab6
lab: kubernetes
order: 1
---
```

**Here is a breakdown of the Front Matter:**
- `layout:` This is the layout that is used for the page. This should match the layout of the landing page.
- `title:` The title of the Lab.
- `permalink:` This is the shorthand link for the individual lab step - this keep this lab at a permanent place in the site.
- `lab:` Define this to match the Lab. This is necessary for the Table of Contents to pick up on the particular Lab and add it to the proper navigation.
- `order: 1` This is set to say this page is a top level item (all Labs have this to ensure their proper place in the site).


## Linking

When creating a link within KubeVirt.io, they all should include `{{ site.baseurl }}` before the location.

Example are `href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image1.jpg"` to properly locate the file `image1.jpg`. For page linking, you would use `href="{{ site.baseurl }}/quickstart_minikube"` to link to the Get KubeVirt information.

## Features

As part of KubeVirt.io, comments on Blog Posts and connections to Twitter are now enabled. Depending on your content settings, you will see Disqus conversation blocks at the end of each Blog Post, as well as a "Tweet" button, enabling you to post a Tweet a link to the Post, the Title and tag the @kubevirt account.

Under the Community page, depending on your content settings, you will be able to see a live feed of the @kubevirt account.

## Test your changes in a local container

### Run a jekyll container

* On a SELinux enabled OS:

    ```console
    cd kubevirt.github.io
    sudo docker run -d --name kubevirtio -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/srv/jekyll:Z jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve --watch
    ```
    
    **NOTE**: Be sure to cd into the *kubevirt.github.io* directory before running the above command as the Z at the end of the volume (-v) will relabel its contents so it can be written from within the container, like running `chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t -l s0:c1,c2` yourself.

* On an OS without SELinux:

    ```console
    cd kubevirt.github.io
    sudo docker run -d --name kubevirtio -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/srv/jekyll jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve --watch
    ```

### View the site

Visit `http://0.0.0.0:4000` in your local browser.
The KubeVirt.io website is a Jekyll site, hosted with GitHub Pages.

All pages are located under `/pages`. Each section of the site is broken out into their respective folders - `/blogs` for the various Blog pages, `/docs` for the Documentation and `/videos` for the videos that are shared.

All site images are located under `/assets/images`. Please do not edit these images.

Images that relate to blog entries are located under `/assets/images/BLOG_POST_TITLE`. The **BLOG_POST_TITLE** should match the name of the markdown file that you added under `/_posts`.
