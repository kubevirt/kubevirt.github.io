The KubeVirt project is looking for new contributors with a variety of skills
and interests. The only prerequisite is an interest & passion for managing KVM
virtual machines on the Kubernetes platform. A *non-exhaustive* list of possible
areas for contribution includes:

* **Software development**: the primary codebase integrating with Kubernetes is
written in Go, and leverages libvirt and KVM on Linux hosts.
* **Website curation**: this website is maintained in markdown served by the
Jekyll content publishing system. There is a need for people to both author new
content and curate the existing content to better serve the needs of the project
* **Testing**: the project aims to utilize automated testing where practical.
There is always scope to broaden the test scenarios, whether by providing new
host platforms to execute tests on, or writing new tests, or even doing manual
testing of things which can't be automated yet.
* **User assistance**: while the project aims to provide an easy on-ramp for
new users deploying the code, there will always be times where users to seek
assistance from experts. Those interested in support are encouraged to engage
with users in the forums, IRC channel, and any other appropriate venue.
* **Evangalism**: a project is nothing without users, so there is a critical
need for people to spread knowledge & passion about the project to potential
new users & contributors.

For contributions which involve changes to the project's GIT repositories,
consult the [contribution workflow](/contrib-workflow) document.

## Instant messaging / chat

The project uses the ``#kubevirt`` IRC channel on the [Freenode
network](https://irc.freenode.net). IRC is accessible from a wide variety of
desktop messaging applications, or alternatively use the [generic in-browser
client](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/kubevirt)

When using IRC bear in mind that project members are on a variety of timezones,
so will not neccessarily be online at the same time as you. This also means
that many members will inevitably miss conversations that take place online.
For these reasons, detailed technical design discussions are often better held
over email, leaving IRC for matters which require realtime engagement.

## E-Mail / Forums

The project uses the ``kubevirt-dev`` Google Group as a forum for developer
discussions. To join the group, visit [the online web
interface](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev). After joining
messages can be sent either via the web interface, or directly via e-mail to
the address [``kubevirt-dev@googlegroups.com``](mailto:kubevirt-dev@googlegroups.com)

## Development resources

The development of KubeVirt relies on a number of online services

## Source repository

All the source code assocaited with the project is managed in the GIT version
control system, [hosted on github](https://github.com/kubevirt/). The primary
repositories are:

* [kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt) - The core infrastructure for integrating with and extending Kubernetes, to host KVM virtual machines.
* [kubevirt.github.io](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt.github.io) - The source for this entire website
* [project-infra](https://github.com/kubevirt/project-infra) - Miscellaneous project infrastructure tools

## Social media

The project maintains a presence in various social media systems to spread news
and other interesting information related to the project
