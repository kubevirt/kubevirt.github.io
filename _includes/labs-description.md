## What’s next: Labs

After you have deployed KubeVirt you can work through the labs to help you get acquainted with KubeVirt and how it can be used to create and deploy VMs with Kubernetes.

The first lab is [“Use KubeVirt”](/labs/kubernetes/lab1). This lab walks through the creation of a Virtual Machine Instance (VMI) on Kubernetes and then how virtctl is used to interact with its console.

The second lab is [“Experiment with CDI”](/labs/kubernetes/lab2). This lab shows how to use the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) to import a VM image into a [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) (PVC) and then how to attach the PVC to a VM as a block device.

The third lab is [“KubeVirt upgrades”](/labs/kubernetes/lab3). This lab shows how easy and safe is to upgrade the KubeVirt installation with zero down-time.
