title: Run KVM on Kubernetes
---

<p>
The high level goal of the project is to build a Kubernetes add-on to enable
management of <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org">KVM]</a>, via
<a href="https://libvirt.org">libvirt</a>. The intent is that over the long
term this would enable application container workloads, and virtual machines,
to be managed from a single place via the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> native API and objects. This
will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a migration path to Kubernetes for existing applications deployed in
  virtual machines, allowing them to more seemlessly integrate with application
  container and take advantage of Kubernetes concepts</li>
<li>Provide a converged API and object model for tenant users needing to manage
  both application containers and full OS image virtual machines</li>
<li>Provide converged infrastructure for administrators wishing to support both
  application containers and full machine virtualization concurrently</li>
<li>Facilitate the creation of virtual compute nodes to use KVM to strongly
isolate application container PODs belonging to tenant users with differing
trust levels</li>
</ul>
