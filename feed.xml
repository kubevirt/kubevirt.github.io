<h2 id="what-is-kubevirt-summit">What is KubeVirt Summit?</h2>

<p>KubeVirt Summit is our annual online conference, now in its fourth year, in which the entire broader community meets to showcase technical architecture, new features, proposed changes, and in-depth tutorials.
We have two tracks to cater for developer talks, and another for end users to share their deployment journey with KubeVirt and their use case(s) at scale. And there’s no reason why a talk can’t be both :)</p>

<h2 id="when-is-it">When is it?</h2>

<p>The event will take place online over two half-days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dates: June 25 and 26, 2024</li>
  <li>Time: TBD 
(In the past we have aimed for 1200-1700 UTC but may modify these times slightly depending on our speaker timezones)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-submit-a-proposal">How to submit a proposal?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Please submit through this [Googleform]](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeELmfpD_20kZnrciXkdSdDS_MLFLN9xSaZDKptNPjg3JGLaA/viewform)</li>
  <li>CfP closes: May 20, 2024</li>
  <li>Schedule will announced at the end of May</li>

This comes 17 weeks after our celebrated v1.0 release, and follows the predictable schedule we moved to three releases ago to follow the Kubernetes release cadence.</p>

<p>You can read the full <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tag/v1.1.0">v1.1 release notes here</a>, but we’ve asked the KubeVirt SIGs to summarize their largest successes, as well as one of the community members from Arm to list their integration accomplishments for this release.</p>

<h2 id="sig-compute">SIG-compute</h2>
<p>SIG-compute covers the core functionality of KubeVirt. This includes scheduling VMs, the API, and all KubeVirt operators.</p>

<p>For the v1.1 release, we have added quite a few features. This includes memory hotplug, as a follow up to CPU hotplug, which was part of the 1.0 release. Basic KSM support was already part of KubeVirt, but we have now extended that with more tuning parameters and KubeVirt can also dynamically configure KSM based on system pressure. We’ve added persistent NVRAM support (requires that a VM use UEFI) so that settings are preserved across reboots.</p>

<p>We’ve also added host-side USB passthrough support, so that USB devices on a cluster node can be made available to workloads. KubeVirt can now automatically apply limits to a VM running in a namespace with quotas. We’ve also added refinements to VM cloning, as well as the ability to create clones using the virtctl CLI tool. And you can now stream guest’s console logs.</p>

<p>Finally, on the confidential computing front, we now have an API for SEV attestation.</p>

<h2 id="sig-infra">SIG-infra</h2>
<p>SIG-infra takes care of KubeVirt’s own infrastructure, user workloads and other user-focused integrations through automation and the reduction of complexity wherever possible, providing a quality experience for end users.</p>

<p>In this release, two major instance type-related features were added to KubeVirt. The first feature is the deployment of Common InstanceTypes by the virt-operator. This provides users with a useful set of InstanceTypes and Preferences right out of the box and allows them to easily create virtual machines tailored to the needs of their workloads. For now this feature remains behind a feature gate, but in future versions we aim to enable the deployment by default.</p>

<p>Secondly, the inference of InstanceTypes and Preferences has been enabled by default when creating virtual machines with virtctl. This feature was already present in the previous release, but users still needed to explicitly enable it. Now it is enabled by default, being as transparent as possible so as to not let the creation of virtual machines fail if inference should not be possible. This significantly improves usability, as the command line for creating virtual machines is now even simpler.</p>

<h2 id="sig-network">SIG-network</h2>
<p>SIG-network is committed to enhancing and maintaining all aspects of Virtual Machine network connectivity and management in KubeVirt.</p>

<p>For the v1.1 release, we have re-designed the interface hot plug/unplug API, while adding hotplug support for SR-IOV interfaces. On top of that, we have added a network binding option allowing the community to extend the KubeVirt network configuration in the pod by injecting custom CNI plugins to configure the networking stack, and a sidecar to configure the libvirt domain. The existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slirp</code> network configuration has been extracted from the code and re-designed as one such network binding, and can be used by the community as an example on how to extend KubeVirt bindings.</p>

<h2 id="sig-scale">SIG-scale</h2>
<p>SIG-scale continues to track scale and performance across releases.  The v1.1 testing lanes ran on Kubernetes 1.27 and we observed a slight performance improvement from Kubernetes.  There’s no other notable performance or scale changes in KubeVirt v1.1 as our focus has been on improving our tracking.</p>

<h2 id="sig-storage">SIG-storage</h2>
<p>SIG-storage is focused on providing persistent storage to KubeVirt VMs and managing that storage throughout the lifecycle of the VM. This begins with provisioning and populating PVCs with bootable images but also includes features such as disk hotplug, snapshots, backup and restore, disaster recovery, and virtual machine export.</p>

<p>For this release we aimed to draw closer to Kubernetes principles when it comes to managing storage artifacts. Introducing CDI volume populators, which is CDI’s implementation of importing/uploading/cloning data to PVCs using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataSourceRef</code> field. This follows the Kubernetes way of populating PVCs and enables us to populate PVCs directly without the need for DataVolumes, an important but bespoke object that has served the KubeVirt use case for many years.</p>

<p>Speaking of DataVolumes, they will no longer be garbage collected by default, something that violated a fundamental principle of Kubernetes (even though it was very useful for our use case).</p>

<p>And, finally, we can now use snapshots to store operating system “golden images”, to serve as the base image for cloning.</p>

<h2 id="kubevirt-and-arm">KubeVirt and Arm</h2>
<p>We are excited to announce the successful integration of KubeVirt on Arm64 platforms. Here are some key accomplishments:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Building and Compiling</strong>: We have released multi-architecture KubeVirt component images and binaries, while also allowing cross-compiling Arm64 architecture images and binaries on x86_64 platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Core Functionality</strong>: Our dedicated efforts have focused on enabling the core functionality of KubeVirt on Arm64 platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing Integration</strong>: Quality assurance is of paramount importance. We have integrated unit tests and end-to-end tests on Arm64 servers into the pull request (PR) pre-submit process. This guarantees that KubeVirt maintains its reliability and functionality on Arm64.</li>
  <li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation</strong>: To provide valuable insights into KubeVirt’s capabilities on Arm64 platforms, we have compiled extensive documentation. Explore the status of <a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/feature_gate_status_on_Arm64/">feature gates</a> and dive into <a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/device_status_on_Arm64/">device status documentation</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Cluster Compatibility Preview</strong>: Hybrid x86_64 and Arm64 clusters can work together now as a preview feature. Try it out and provide feedback.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are thrilled to declare that KubeVirt now offers tier-one support on Arm64 platforms. This milestone represents a culmination of collaborative efforts, unwavering dedication, and a commitment to innovation within the KubeVirt community. KubeVirt is no longer just an option; it has evolved to become a first-class citizen on Arm64 platforms.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For this article, we’ll learn about the process of setting up
<a href="https://kubevirt.io/">KubeVirt</a> with <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md">Cluster
Autoscaler</a>
on EKS. In addition, we’ll be using bare metal nodes to host KubeVirt VMs.</p>

<h2 id="required-base-knowledge">Required Base Knowledge</h2>

<p>This article will talk about how to make various software systems work together
but introducing each one in detail is outside of its scope. Thus, you must already:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Know how to administer a Kubernetes cluster;</li>
  <li>Be familiar with AWS, specifically IAM and EKS; and</li>
  <li>Have some experience with KubeVirt.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="companion-code">Companion Code</h2>

<p>All the code used in this article may also be found at
<a href="https://github.com/relaxdiego/kubevirt-cas-baremetal">github.com/relaxdiego/kubevirt-cas-baremetal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-the-cluster">Set Up the Cluster</h2>

<h3 id="shared-environment-variables">Shared environment variables</h3>

<p>First let’s set some environment variables:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># The name of the EKS cluster we're going to create</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RD_CLUSTER_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>my-cluster

<span class="c"># The region where we will create the cluster</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RD_REGION</span><span class="o">=</span>us-west-2

<span class="c"># Kubernetes version to use</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RD_K8S_VERSION</span><span class="o">=</span>1.27

<span class="c"># The name of the keypair that we're going to inject into the nodes. You</span>
<span class="c"># must create this ahead of time in the correct region.</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RD_EC2_KEYPAIR_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>eks-my-cluster
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="prepare-the-clusteryaml-file">Prepare the cluster.yaml file</h3>

<p>Using <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a>, prepare an EKS cluster config:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eksctl create cluster <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--dry-run</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RD_CLUSTER_NAME</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--nodegroup-name</span> ng-infra <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--node-type</span> m5.xlarge <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--nodes</span> 2 <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--nodes-min</span> 2 <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--nodes-max</span> 2 <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--node-labels</span> <span class="nv">workload</span><span class="o">=</span>infra <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--region</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RD_REGION</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--ssh-access</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--ssh-public-key</span> <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RD_EC2_KEYPAIR_NAME</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--version</span> <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RD_K8S_VERSION</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--vpc-nat-mode</span> HighlyAvailable <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nt">--with-oidc</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> cluster.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--dry-run</code> means the command will not actually create the cluster but will
instead output a config to stdout which we then write to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster.yaml</code>.</p>

<p>Open the file and look at what it has produced.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more info on the schema used by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster.yaml</code>, see the <a href="https://eksctl.io/usage/schema/">Config file
schema</a> page from eksctl.io</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This cluster will start out with a node group that we will use to host our
“infra” services. This is why we are using the cheaper <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m5.xlarge</code> rather than
a baremetal instance type. However, we also need to ensure that none of our VMs
will ever be scheduled in these nodes. Thus we need to taint them. In the
generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster.yaml</code> file, append the following taint to the only node
group in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">managedNodeGroups</code> list:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">managedNodeGroups</span><span class="pi">:</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">amiFamily</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">AmazonLinux2</span>
  <span class="s">...</span>
  <span class="na">taints</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">CriticalAddonsOnly</span>
      <span class="na">effect</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">NoSchedule</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="create-the-cluster">Create the cluster</h3>

<p>We can now create the cluster:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>eksctl create cluster <span class="nt">--config-file</span> cluster.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Example output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023-08-20 07:59:14 [ℹ]  eksctl version ...
2023-08-20 07:59:14 [ℹ]  using region us-west-2 ...
2023-08-20 07:59:14 [ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2a ...
2023-08-20 07:59:14 [ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2b ...
2023-08-20 07:59:14 [ℹ]  subnets for us-west-2c ...
...
2023-08-20 08:14:06 [ℹ]  kubectl command should work with ...
2023-08-20 08:14:06 [✔]  EKS cluster "my-cluster" in "us-west-2" is ready
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the command is done, you should be able to query the the kube API. For
example:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kubectl get nodes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Example output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NAME                      STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-XXX.compute.internal   Ready    &lt;none&gt;   32m     v1.27.4-eks-2d98532
ip-YYY.compute.internal   Ready    &lt;none&gt;   32m     v1.27.4-eks-2d98532
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="create-the-node-groups">Create the Node Groups</h3>

<p>As per <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws/README.md">this section of the Cluster Autoscaler
docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re using Persistent Volumes, your deployment needs to run in the same
AZ as where the EBS volume is, otherwise the pod scheduling could fail if it
is scheduled in a different AZ and cannot find the EBS volume. To overcome
this, either use a single AZ ASG for this use case, or an ASG-per-AZ while
enabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--balance-similar-node-groups</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the above, we will create a node group for each of the availability
zones (AZs) that was declared in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster.yaml</code> so that the Cluster Autoscaler will
always bring up a node in the AZ where a VM’s EBS-backed PV is located.</p>

<p>To do that, we will first prepare a template that we can then feed to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">envsubst</code>. Save the following in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node-group.yaml.template</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last few tags bears additional emphasis. They are required because when a
virtual machine is created, it will have the following requirements:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">requests</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">devices.kubevirt.io/kvm</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>

<span class="na">nodeSelectors</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">kubevirt.io/schedulable=true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, at least when scaling from zero for the first time, CAS will have no
knowledge of this information unless the correct AWS tags are added to the node
group. This is why we have the following added to the managed node group’s
tags:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/resources/devices.kubevirt.io/kvm</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">1"</span>

<h3 id="create-the-vm-node-groups">Create the VM Node Groups</h3>

<p>We can now create the node group:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yq .availabilityZones[] cluster.yaml <span class="nt">-r</span> | <span class="se">\</span>

<h2 id="deploy-kubevirt">Deploy KubeVirt</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following was adapted from <a href="https://kubevirt.io/quickstart_cloud/">KubeVirt quickstart with cloud

<p>Deploy the KubeVirt operator:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kubectl create <span class="nt">-f</span> https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/v1.0.0/kubevirt-operator.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So that the operator will know how to deploy KubeVirt, let’s add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KubeVirt</code>
resource:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="no">EOF</span><span class="sh"> | kubectl apply -f -

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice how we are specifically configuring KubeVirt itself to tolerate the

can be scheduled in the infra nodes instead of the bare metal nodes which we

<h3 id="prepare-the-permissions-for-cluster-autoscaler">Prepare the permissions for Cluster Autoscaler</h3>

<p>So that CAS can set the desired capacity of each node group dynamically, we
must grant it limited access to certain AWS resources. The first step to this
is to define the IAM policy.</p>

  <p>This section is based off of the “Create an IAM policy and role” section of
the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/autoscaling.html">AWS

<p>Next, deploy the cluster autoscaler using the deployment template that I
prepared in the <a href="https://github.com/relaxdiego/kubevirt-cas-baremetal">companion
repo</a></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>envsubst &lt; &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relaxdiego/kubevirt-cas-baremetal/main/cas-deployment.yaml.template<span class="o">)</span> | <span class="se">\</span>

<p>Once the timeout has been reached (default: 10 minutes), CAS will scale down
the group:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Scale-down: removing empty node ip-XXXX.YYYY.compute.internal

<p>When you try to get the list of nodes, you should see the bare metal nodes
tainted such that they are no longer schedulable:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a few more minutes, the nodes will be deleted.</p>

<p>To try the scale up, just deploy a VM.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Expanding Node Group eks-ng-eacf8ebb ...

<p>Infrastructure teams managing virtual machines (VMs) and the end users of these systems make use of a variety of tools as part of their day-to-day world. One such tool that is shared amongst these two groups is Ansible, an agentless automation tool for the enterprise. To simplify both the adoption and usage of KubeVirt as well as to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows, the KubeVirt community is excited to introduce the release of the first version of the KubeVirt collection for <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible</a>, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code>, which includes a number of tools that you do not want to miss.</p>

<p>This article will review some of the features and their use associated with this initial release.</p>

<p>Note: There is also a video version of this blog, which can be found on the <a href="https://youtu.be/GVROaPgJD_8">KubeVirt YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Before diving into the featureset of the collection itself, let’s review why the collection was created in the first place.</p>

<p>While adopting KubeVirt and Kubernetes has the potential to disrupt the workflows of teams that typically manage VM infrastructure, including the end users themselves, many of the same paradigms remain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kubernetes and the resources associated with KubeVirt can be represented in a declarative fashion.</li>
  <li>In many cases, communicating with KubeVirt VMs makes use of the same protocols and schemes as non-Kubernetes-based environments.</li>
  <li>The management of VMs still represents a challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons and more, it is only natural that a tool, like Ansible, is introduced within the KubeVirt community. Not only can it help manage KubeVirt and Kubernetes resources, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VirtualMachines</code>, but also to enable the extensive Ansible ecosystem for managing guest configurations.</p>

<h2 id="included-capabilities">Included capabilities</h2>

<p>As part of the initial release, an <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/inventory.html">Ansible Inventory plugin</a> and management module is included. They are available in the same distribution location containing Ansible automation content, <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/kubevirt/core">Ansible Galaxy</a>. The resources encompassing the collection itself are detailed in the following sections.</p>

<h3 id="inventory">Inventory</h3>

<p>To work with KubeVirt VMs in Ansible, they need to be available in Ansible’s hosts <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html">inventory</a>. Since KubeVirt is already using the Kubernetes API to manage VMs, it would be nice to leverage this API to discover hosts with Ansible too. This is where the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html">dynamic inventory</a> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> collection comes into play.</p>

<p>The dynamic inventory capability allows you to query the Kubernetes API for available VMs in a given namespace or namespaces, along with additional filtering options, such as labels. To allow Ansible to find the right connection parameters for a VM, the network name of a secondary interface can also be specified.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the dynamic inventory uses either your default kubectl credentials or credentials specified in the inventory parameters to establish the connection with a cluster.</p>

<h3 id="managing-vms">Managing VMs</h3>

<p>While working with existing VMs is already quite useful, it would be even better to control the entire lifecycle of KubeVirt <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VirtualMachines</code> from Ansible. This is made possible by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt_vm</code> module provided by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> collection.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt_vm</code> module is a thin wrapper around the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html">kubernetes.core.k8s</a> module and it allows you to control the essential fields of a KubeVirt <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VirtualMachine</code>’s specification. In true Ansible fashion, this module tries to be as idempotent as possible and only makes changes to objects within Kubernetes if necessary. With its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait</code> feature, it is possible to delay further tasks until a VM was successfully created or updated and the VM is in the ready state or was successfully deleted.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve provided an introduction to the featureset, it is time to illustrate how you can get up to speed using the collection including a few examples to showcase the capabilities provided by the collection.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Please note that as a prerequisite, Ansible needs to be installed and configured along with a working Kubernetes cluster with KubeVirt and the <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/cluster-network-addons-operator">KubeVirt Cluster Network Addons Operator</a>. The cluster also needs to have a <a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/interfaces_and_networks/#bridge">secondary network configured</a>, which can be attached to VMs so that the machine can be reached from the Ansible control node.</p>

<h3 id="items-covered">Items covered</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Installing the collection from Ansible Galaxy</li>
  <li>Creating a Namespace and a Secret with an SSH public key</li>
  <li>Creating a VM</li>
  <li>Listing available VMs</li>
  <li>Executing a command on the VM</li>
  <li>Removing the previously created resources</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h3>

<p>First, install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> collection from Ansible Galaxy:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ansible-galaxy collection <span class="nb">install </span>kubevirt.core
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will also install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubernetes.core</code> collection as a dependency.</p>

<p>Second, create a new Namespace and a Secret containing a public key for SSH authentication:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-f</span> my-key
kubectl create namespace kubevirt-ansible
kubectl create secret generic my-pub-key <span class="nt">--from-file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">key1</span><span class="o">=</span>my-key.pub <span class="nt">-n</span> kubevirt-ansible
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run the playbook by executing the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ansible-playbook play-create.yml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the playbook completes successfully, the defined VM will be running in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt-ansible</code> namespace, which can be confirmed by querying for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VirtualMachines</code> in this namespace:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kubectl get VirtualMachine <span class="nt">-n</span> kubevirt-ansible
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the VM deployed, it is eligible for use in Ansible automation activities. Let’s illustrate how it can be queried and added to an Ansible inventory dynamically using the plugin provided by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> collection.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inventory.kubevirt.yml</code> containing the following content:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">plugin</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">kubevirt.core.kubevirt</span>

  <span class="na">label_selector</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">app=test</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible-inventory</code> command to confirm the VM becomes added to the Ansible inventory:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ansible-inventory <span class="nt">-i</span> inventory.kubevirt.yml <span class="nt">--list</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, make use of the host by querying for all of the facts exposed by the VM using the setup module:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ansible <span class="nt">-i</span> inventory.kubevirt.yml <span class="nt">-u</span> fedora <span class="nt">--key-file</span> my-key all <span class="nt">-m</span> setup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Complete the lifecycle of the VM by destroying the previously created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VirtualMachine</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Namespace</code>. Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play-delete.yml</code> containing the following playbook:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">hosts</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">localhost</span>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>This has been a brief introduction to the concepts and usage of the newly released <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> collection. Nevertheless, we hope that it helped to showcase the integration now available between KubeVirt and Ansible, including how easy it is to manage KubeVirt assets. A next potential iteration could be to expose a VM via a Kubernetes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Service</code> using one of the methods described in <a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/virtual_machines/service_objects/#service-objects">this article</a> instead of a secondary interface as was covered in this walkthrough. Not only does it leverage existing models outside the KubeVirt ecosystem, but it helps to enable a uniform method for exposing content.</p>

<p>Interested in learning more, providing feedback or contributing? Head over to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubevirt.core</code> GitHub repository to continue your journey and get involved.</p>

<p>Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">NetworkPolicies</a> are constructs to control traffic flow at the IP
address or port level (OSI layers 3 or 4).
They allow the user to specify how a pod (or group of pods) is allowed to
communicate with other entities on the network. In simpler words: the user can
specify ingress from or egress to other workloads, using L3 / L4 semantics.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkPolicy</code> is a Kubernetes construct - which only cares
about a single network interface - they are only usable for the cluster’s
default network interface. This leaves a considerable gap for Virtual Machine
users, since they are heavily invested in secondary networks.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg">k8snetworkplumbingwg</a> has addressed this limitation by providing a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiNetworkPolicy</code> CRD - it features the exact same API as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkPolicy</code>
but can target <a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/docs/how-to-use.md#create-network-attachment-definition">network-attachment-definitions</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes">OVN-Kubernetes</a> implements this API, and configures access control accordingly
for secondary networks in the cluster.</p>

<p>In this post we will see how we can govern access control for VMs using the
multi-network policy API. On our simple example, we’ll only allow into our VMs
for traffic ingressing from a particular CIDR range.</p>

<h2 id="current-limitations-of-multinetworkpolicies-for-vms">Current limitations of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiNetworkPolicies</code> for VMs</h2>
<p>Kubernetes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NetworkPolicy</code> has three types of policy peers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>namespace selectors: allows ingress-from, egress-to based on the peer’s namespace labels</li>
  <li>pod selectors: allows ingress-from, egress-to based on the peer’s labels</li>
  <li>ip block: allows ingress-from, egress-to based on the peer’s IP address</li>
</ul>

<p>While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiNetworkPolicy</code> allows these three types, when used with VMs we
recommend using <strong>only</strong> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IPBlock</code> policy peer - both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">namespace</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pod</code>
selectors prevent the live-migration of Virtual Machines (these policy peers
require OVN-K managed IPAM, and currently the live-migration feature is only
available when IPAM is not enabled on the interfaces).</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>To run this demo, we will prepare a Kubernetes cluster with the following
components installed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes">OVN-Kubernetes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni">multus-cni</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt">KubeVirt</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multi-networkpolicy">Multi-Network policy API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#setup-demo-environment">following section</a> will show you how to create a
<a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">KinD</a> cluster, with upstream latest OVN-Kubernetes,
upstream latest multus-cni, and the multi-network policy CRDs deployed.</p>

<h3 id="setup-demo-environment">Setup demo environment</h3>
<p>Refer to the OVN-Kubernetes repo
<a href="https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/kind.md#ovn-kubernetes-kind-setup">KIND documentation</a>
for more details; the gist of it is you should clone the OVN-Kubernetes
repository, and run their kind helper script:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone git@github.com:ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes.git

<span class="nb">cd </span>ovn-kubernetes
<span class="nb">pushd </span>contrib <span class="p">;</span> ./kind.sh <span class="nt">--multi-network-enable</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">popd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will get you a running kind cluster (one control plane, and two worker
nodes), configured to use OVN-Kubernetes as the default cluster network,
configuring the multi-homing OVN-Kubernetes feature gate, and deploying
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multus-cni</code> in the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="install-kubevirt-in-the-cluster">Install KubeVirt in the cluster</h3>
<p>Follow Kubevirt’s
<a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/#installing-kubevirt-on-kubernetes">user guide</a>
to install the latest released version (currently, v1.0.0).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RELEASE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>curl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubevirt-prow/release/kubevirt/kubevirt/stable.txt<span class="si">)</span>
kubectl apply <span class="nt">-f</span> <span class="s2">"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RELEASE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">/kubevirt-operator.yaml"</span>
kubectl apply <span class="nt">-f</span> <span class="s2">"https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/download/</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">RELEASE</span><span class="k">}</span><span class="s2">/kubevirt-cr.yaml"</span>
kubectl <span class="nt">-n</span> kubevirt <span class="nb">wait </span>kv kubevirt <span class="nt">--timeout</span><span class="o">=</span>360s <span class="nt">--for</span> <span class="nv">condition</span><span class="o">=</span>Available
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a Kubernetes cluster with all the pieces to start the Demo.</p>

<h3 id="limiting-ingress-to-a-kubevirt-vm">Limiting ingress to a KubeVirt VM</h3>
<p>In this example, we will configure a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiNetworkPolicy</code> allowing ingress into
our VMs only from a particular CIDR range - let’s say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.200.0.0/30</code>.</p>

<p>Provision the following NAD (to allow our VMs to live-migrate, we do not define
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subnet</code>):</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">apiVersion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1</span>

            <span class="s">"netAttachDefName": "default/flatl2net"</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s now provision our six VMs, with the following name to IP address
(statically configured via cloud-init) association:</p>
<ul>
  <li>vm1: 10.200.0.1</li>
  <li>vm2: 10.200.0.2</li>
  <li>vm3: 10.200.0.3</li>
  <li>vm4: 10.200.0.4</li>
  <li>vm5: 10.200.0.5</li>
  <li>vm6: 10.200.0.6</li>

This release demonstrates the accomplishments of the community and user adoption over the years and represents an important milestone for everyone involved.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history">A brief history</h2>
<p>The KubeVirt project started in Red Hat at the end of 2016, with the question: Can virtual machines (VMs) run in containers and be deployed by Kubernetes?
It proved to be not only possible, but quickly emerged as a promising solution to the future of virtual machines in the container age.
KubeVirt joined the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> as a Sandbox project in September 2019, and an Incubating project in April 2022.
From a handful of people hacking away on a proof of concept, KubeVirt has grown into 45 active repositories, with the primary <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt">kubevirt/kubevirt</a> repo having 17k commits and 1k forks.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-v10-mean-to-the-community">What does v1.0 mean to the community?</h2>
<p>The v1.0 release signifies the incredible growth that the community has gone through in the past six years from an idea to a production-ready Virtual Machine Management solution. The next stage with v1.0 is the additional focus on maintaining APIs while continuing to grow the project. This has led KubeVirt to adopt community practices from Kubernetes in key parts of the project.</p>

<p>Leading up to this release we had a shift in release cadence: from monthly to 3 times a year, following the Kubernetes release model. This allows our developer community additional time to ensure stability and compatibility, our users more time to plan and comfortably upgrade, and also aligns our releases with Kubernetes to simplify maintenance and supportability.</p>

<p>The theme ‘aligning with Kubernetes’ is also felt through the other parts of the community, by following their governance processes; introducing SIGs to split test and review responsibilities, as well as a SIG release repo to handle everything related to a release; and regular <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=kubevirt@cncf.io">SIG meetings</a> that now include SIG scale and performance and SIG storage alongside our weekly Community meetings.</p>

<h2 id="whats-included-in-this-release">What’s included in this release?</h2>

<p>This release demonstrates the accomplishments of the community and user adoption over the past many months. The full list of feature and bug fixes can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a>, but we’ve also asked representatives from some of our SIGs for a summary.</p>

<h3 id="sig-scale">SIG-scale</h3>
<p>KubeVirt’s SIG-scale drives the performance and scalability initiatives in the community. Our focus for the v1.0 release was on sharing the performance results over the past 6 months. The benchmarks since December 2022 which cover the past two release - v0.59 (Mar 2023) and v1.0 (July 2023) are as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/release-1.0/docs/release-v1-perf-scale-benchmarks.md#performance-benchmarks-for-v1-release">Performance benchmarks for v1.0 release</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/release-1.0/docs/release-v1-perf-scale-benchmarks.md#scalability-benchmarks-for-v1-release">Scalability benchmarks for v1.0 release</a></p>

<p>Publishing these measurements provides the community and end-users visibility into the performance and scalability over multiple releases. In addition, these results help identify the effects of code changes so that community members can diagnose performance problems and regressions.</p>

<p>End-users can use the same tools and techniques SIG-scale uses to analyze performance and scalability in their own deployments. Since performance and scalability are mostly relative to the deployment stack, the same strategies should be used to further contextualize the community’s measurements.</p>

<h3 id="sig-storage">SIG-storage</h3>
<p>SIG-storage is focused on providing persistent storage to KubeVirt VMs and managing that storage throughout the lifecycle of the VM. This begins with provisioning and populating PVCs with bootable images but also includes features such as disk hotplug, snapshots, backup and restore, disaster recovery, and virtual machine export.</p>

<p>For v1.0, SIG-storage delivered the following features: providing a flexible VM export API, enabling persistent SCSI reservation, provisioning VMs from a retained snapshot, and setting out-of-the-box defaults for additional storage provisioners. Another major effort was to implement Volume Populator alternatives to the KubeVirt DataVolume API in order to better leverage platform capabilities. The SIG meets every 2 weeks and welcomes anyone to join us for interesting storage discussions.</p>

<h3 id="sig-compute">SIG-compute</h3>
<p>SIG-compute is focused on the core virtualization functionality of KubeVirt, but also encompasses features that don’t fit well into another SIG. Some examples of SIG-compute’s scope include the lifecycle of VMs, migration, as well as maintenance of the core API.</p>

<p>For v1.0, SIG-compute developed features for memory over-commit. This includes initial support for KSM and FreePageReporting. We added support for persistent vTPM, which makes it much easier to use BitLocker on Windows installs. Additionally, there’s now an initial implementation for CPU Hotplug (currently hidden behind a feature gate).</p>

<h3 id="sig-network">SIG-network</h3>
<p>SIG-network is committed to enhancing and maintaining all aspects of Virtual Machine network connectivity and management in KubeVirt.</p>

<p>For the v1.0 release, we have introduced hot plug and hot unplug (as alpha), which enables users to add and remove VM secondary network interfaces that use bridge binding on a running VM. Hot plug API stabilization and support for SR-IOV interfaces is under development for the next minor release.</p>

<h3 id="sig-infra">SIG-infra</h3>
<p>The effort to simplify the VirtualMachine UX is still ongoing and with the v1.0 release we were able to introduce the v1beta1 version of the instancetype.kubevirt.io API. In the future KubeVirt v1.1.0 release we are aiming to finally graduate the instancetype.kubevirt.io API to v1.</p>

<p>With the new version it is now possible to control the memory overcommit of virtual machines as a percentage within instance types. Resource requirements were added to preferences, which allows users to ensure that requirements of a workload are met. Also several new preference attributes have been added to cover more use cases.</p>

<p>Moreover, virtctl was extended to make use of the new instance type and preference features.</p>

<h2 id="what-next-for-kubevirt">What next for KubeVirt?</h2>
<p>From a development perspective, we will continue to introduce and improve features that make life easier for virtualization users in a manner that is as native to Kubernetes as possible. From a community perspective, we are improving our new contributor experience so that we can continue to grow and help new members learn and be a part of the cloud native ecosystem. In addition, with this milestone we can now shift our attention on becoming a CNCF Graduated project.</p>]]></content><author><name>KubeVirt Maintainers</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="KubeVirt" /><category term="v1.0" /><category term="release" /><category term="community" /><category term="cncf" /><category term="milestone" /><category term="party time" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very pleased to announce the release of KubeVirt v1.0!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">KubeVirt v1.0.0</title><link href="https://kubevirt.io//2023/changelog-v1.0.0.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="KubeVirt v1.0.0" /><published>2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kubevirt.io//2023/changelog-v1.0.0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kubevirt.io//2023/changelog-v1.0.0.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="v100">v1.0.0</h2>

<p>OVN (Open Virtual Network) is a series of daemons for the Open vSwitch that
translate virtual network configurations into OpenFlow. It provides virtual
networking capabilities for any type of workload on a virtualized platform
(virtual machines and containers) using the same API.</p>

<p>OVN provides a higher-layer of abstraction than Open vSwitch, working with
logical routers and logical switches, rather than flows.
More details can be found in the OVN architecture
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ovn-architecture.7.html#DESCRIPTION">man page</a>.</p>

<p>In this post we will repeat the scenario of
<a href="https://kubevirt.io/2020/Multiple-Network-Attachments-with-bridge-CNI.html">its bridge CNI equivalent</a>,
using this SDN approach. This secondary network topology is akin to the one
described in the <a href="http://kubevirt.io/2023/OVN-kubernetes-secondary-networks.html">flatL2 topology</a>,
but allows connectivity to the physical underlay.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>To run this demo, we will prepare a Kubernetes cluster with the following
components installed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes">OVN-Kubernetes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni">multus-cni</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt">KubeVirt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#environment-setup">following section</a> will show you how to create a
<a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">KinD</a> cluster, with upstream latest OVN-Kubernetes,
and upstream latest multus-cni deployed.</p>

<h3 id="setup-demo-environment">Setup demo environment</h3>
<p>Refer to the OVN-Kubernetes repo
<a href="https://github.com/ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes/blob/master/docs/kind.md#ovn-kubernetes-kind-setup">KIND documentation</a>
for more details; the gist of it is you should clone the OVN-Kubernetes
repository, and run their kind helper script:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone git@github.com:ovn-org/ovn-kubernetes.git

<span class="nb">cd </span>ovn-kubernetes
<span class="nb">pushd </span>contrib <span class="p">;</span> ./kind.sh <span class="nt">--multi-network-enable</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">popd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will get you a running kind cluster, configured to use OVN-Kubernetes as
the default cluster network, configuring the multi-homing OVN-Kubernetes feature
gate, and deploying
<a href="https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni">multus-cni</a> in the cluster.</p>

<h3 id="install-kubevirt-in-the-cluster">Install KubeVirt in the cluster</h3>
<p>Follow Kubevirt’s
<a href="https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/operations/installation/#installing-kubevirt-on-kubernetes">user guide</a>
to install the latest released version (currently, v0.59.0).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">RELEASE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>curl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubevirt-prow/release/kubevirt/kubevirt/stable.txt<span class="si">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a Kubernetes cluster with all the pieces to start the Demo.</p>

<h3 id="single-broadcast-domain">Single broadcast domain</h3>
<p>In this scenario we will see how traffic from a single localnet network can be
connected to a physical network in the host using a dedicated bridge.</p>

<p>This scenario does not use any VLAN encapsulation, thus is simpler, since the
network admin does not need to provision any VLANs in advance.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-the-underlay">Configuring the underlay</h4>
<p>When you’ve started the KinD cluster with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--multi-network-enable</code> flag an
additional OCI network was created, and attached to each of the KinD nodes.</p>

<p>But still, further steps may be required, depending on the desired L2
configuration.</p>

<p>Let’s first create a dedicated OVS bridge, and attach the aforementioned
virtualized network to it:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>node <span class="k">in</span> <span class="si">$(</span>kubectl <span class="nt">-n</span> ovn-kubernetes get pods <span class="nt">-l</span> <span class="nv">app</span><span class="o">=</span>ovs-node <span class="nt">-o</span> <span class="nv">jsonpath</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"{.items[*].metadata.name}"</span><span class="si">)</span>
<span class="k">do
	</span>kubectl <span class="nt">-n</span> ovn-kubernetes <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="nt">-ti</span> <span class="nv">$node</span> <span class="nt">--</span> ovs-vsctl <span class="nt">--may-exist</span> add-br ovsbr1
	kubectl <span class="nt">-n</span> ovn-kubernetes <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="nt">-ti</span> <span class="nv">$node</span> <span class="nt">--</span> ovs-vsctl <span class="nt">--may-exist</span> add-port ovsbr1 eth1
	kubectl <span class="nt">-n</span> ovn-kubernetes <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="nt">-ti</span> <span class="nv">$node</span> <span class="nt">--</span> ovs-vsctl <span class="nb">set </span>open <span class="nb">.</span> external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings<span class="o">=</span>physnet:breth0,localnet-network:ovsbr1
<span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first two commands are self-evident: you create an OVS bridge, and attach
a port to it; the last one is not. In it, we’re using the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.0/html/networking_guide/bridge-mappings">OVN bridge mapping</a>
API to configure which OVS bridge must be used for each physical network.
It creates a patch port between the OVN integration bridge - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">br-int</code> - and the
OVS bridge you tell it to, and traffic will be forwarded to/from it with the
help of a
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/ovn-nb.5.html#Logical_Switch_Port_TABLE">localnet port</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The provided mapping <strong>must</strong> match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> within the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net-attach-def</code>.Spec.Config JSON, otherwise, the patch ports will not be
created.</p>

<p>You will also have to configure an IP address on the bridge for the
extra-network the kind script created. For that, you first need to identify the
bridge’s name. In the example below we’re providing a command for the podman
runtime:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>podman network inspect underlay <span class="nt">--format</span> <span class="s1">'{{ .NetworkInterface }}'</span>
podman3

ip addr add 10.128.0.1/24 dev podman3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> for docker, please use the following command:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ip a | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="sb">`</span>docker network inspect underlay <span class="nt">--format</span> <span class="s1">'{{ index .IPAM.Config 0 "Gateway" }}'</span><span class="sb">`</span> | <span class="nb">awk</span> <span class="s1">'{print $NF}'</span>
br-0aeb0318f71f

ip addr add 10.128.0.1/24 dev br-0aeb0318f71f
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s also use an IP in the same subnet as the network subnet (defined in the
NAD). This IP address must be excluded from the IPAM pool (also on the NAD),
otherwise the OVN-Kubernetes IPAM may assign it to a workload.</p>

<h4 id="defining-the-ovn-kubernetes-networks">Defining the OVN-Kubernetes networks</h4>
<p>Once the underlay is configured, we can now provision the attachment configuration:</p>
<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">apiVersion</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1</span>
<span class="na">kind</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">NetworkAttachmentDefinition</span>
<span class="na">metadata</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">localnet-network</span>
<span class="na">spec</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">config</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|2</span>
    <span class="s">{</span>
            <span class="s">"cniVersion": "0.3.1",</span>
            <span class="s">"name": "localnet-network",</span>
            <span class="s">"type": "ovn-k8s-cni-overlay",</span>
            <span class="s">"topology": "localnet",</span>
            <span class="s">"subnets": "10.128.0.0/24",</span>
            <span class="s">"excludeSubnets": "10.128.0.1/32",</span>
            <span class="s">"netAttachDefName": "default/localnet-network"</span>
    <span class="s">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is required to list the gateway IP in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excludedSubnets</code> attribute, thus
preventing OVN-Kubernetes from assigning that IP address to the workloads.</p>

<h4 id="spin-up-the-vms">Spin up the VMs</h4>
<p>These two VMs can be used for the single broadcast domain scenario (no VLANs).</p>

<h3 id="multiple-physical-networks-pointing-to-the-same-ovs-bridge">Multiple physical networks pointing to the same OVS bridge</h3>
<p>This example will feature 2 physical networks, each with a different VLAN,
both pointing at the same OVS bridge.</p>

<h4 id="configuring-the-underlay-1">Configuring the underlay</h4>
<p>Again, the first thing to do is create a dedicated OVS bridge, and attach the
aforementioned virtualized network to it, while defining it as a trunk port
for two broadcast domains, with tags 10 and 20.</p>

<p>We must now configure the physical network; since the packets are leaving the
OVS bridge tagged with either the 10 or 20 VLAN, we must configure the physical
network where the virtualized nodes run to handle the tagged traffic.</p>

<p>For that we will create two VLANed interfaces, each with a different subnet; we
will need to know the name of the bridge the kind script created to implement
the extra network it required. Those VLAN interfaces also need to be configured
with an IP address: (for docker see previous example)</p>
